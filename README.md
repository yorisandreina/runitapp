# RunIT Mobile App
This is a mobile app created with react native that is functional in both iOS and AndroidOS. It was designed and created based on a legacy mobile app called Run Less Run Faster. The main goal of RunIT is to provide a workout plan for runners who want to train for a race or just improve their skills. The logic behind each workout is based on proven scientific research from the book previously mentioned.

# Technical Aspects
The application uses a Firebase database to store user specific data, so it can be retrieved and kept as a log. The UI follows Angular Material principles for its components, so you can expect a cohesive and easy-to-use UI.
